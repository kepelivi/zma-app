# ZMA (Zene Minden Alkalomra) :musical_note:

ZMA (Zene Minden Alkalomra) is a song request app designed for events featuring live music. With ZMA, guests can seamlessly request songs by scanning a QR code at the event venue. They have the option to either type in the song they want to hear or search by the name/artist using the Spotify API integration.

Once a song request is made, it appears on the DJ's screen, enabling them to see which songs the audience wants to hear. DJs have the flexibility to either confirm a song for playback or reject it if it doesn't fit the vibe or if it's unavailable.
